Pen Testing : Security pen testing, also known as penetration testing or ethical hacking, is a security exercise where a cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system's defenses which attackers could take advantage of. 

Penetration testers use the same tools, techniques, and processes as attackers to find and demonstrate the business impacts of weaknesses in a system.2 The test is performed to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities, including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

Physical penetration testing assesses all physical security controls, including locks, fences, security guards, cameras, and other security measures, and attempts to thwart these controls to gain physical access to restricted areas, identify sensitive data, and gain an entry to a network
